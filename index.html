                        <h3>This is her story...</h3>
                        <p>Andrea Ferrero is a 19-year-old guitarist from Caracas, Venezuela currently based in
                            Boston, MA studying music at Berklee College of Music with a full-tuition scholarship,
                            doing a double major in Performance and Contemporary Music and Production. Her style
                            is very versatile, but also unique, which has led her to play with some of the most popular
                            artists from Venezuela. Playing all different genres such as R&amp;B, Funk, Fusion, Rock,
                            Reggaeton, Neo Soul, and so on. <br><br>
                            Andrea started to play guitar at the age of 9 years old. She said she always had a huge
                            interest for music, which is weird coming from a family of non-musicians. She always
                            felt a connection with music, specifically with the electric guitar, so she started asking
                            her
                            parents for a guitar. They gave one to her as a Christmas gift. Immediately, she started
                            taking classes, and a few months after, she started playing at a catholic church where she
                            used to go every Sunday. <br><br>
                            She generated a big passion for music which made her progress so fast. Everybody was
                            so impressed every time they saw this 10-year-old kid playing so well. <br><br>
                            When she was 14 years old she started to study music in a more professional level. She
                            began to attend to the “Taller the Jazz” in Caracas, where she had the opportunity to learn
                            about this other language which is “jazz”. Andrea was the youngest student there. Being
                            at this school really expanded her knowledge and it also gave the opportunity of getting
                            to know a lot of high-level musicians, and this way, she would also learn from them.
                            At the age of 15, she was already playing on these huge stages and traveling all around
                            the country with some of the most famous artist from Venezuela. <br><br>
                            Having high school and this musician life at the same time is something really hard to
                            deal with, which made Andrea take the decision to change to a different high school,
                            where they would understand her situation and this way she would have more time to
                            dedicate to study music at the “Taller de Jazz” and being out for gigs and rehearsals.
                            From the very beginning, Andrea knew that she wanted to dedicate her life to music.
                            She always wanted to attend to one of the best music schools of the world, Berklee
                            College of Music. <br><br>
                            She found this dream very hard to fulfill due the situation her country Venezuela is going
                            through. Venezuela has been led to the poorness, for this reason she didn’t have money to
                            study at Berklee. She never thought it was impossible though, so she wanted to try and
                            then see what happen. <br><br>
                            She didn’t have enough money to travel in order to take the audition, that’s why she had
                            to take an online audition. She prepared really hard for this and she played an original
                            piece. <br><br>
                            A few months after, she received an acceptance letter and also a scholarship letter saying
                            that she had being accepted with a full-tuition scholarship. A moment she would never
                            forget. She started her new experience at Berklee College of Music in January 2018.
                            Now in Boston, Andrea has had the opportunity to play with so many amazing musicians.
                            She is looking forward to graduate in 2022 with a double major in Guitar Performance
                            and Contemporary Writing and Production. After that, she wants to live her life playing
                            with different artists all around the world, and producing and arranging for them. Andrea
                            wants to leave her mark in the world, making a difference in the music industry and
                            representing the female musicians from all over the world.
